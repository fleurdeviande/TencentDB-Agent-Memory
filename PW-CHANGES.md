# pw/main — what this fork adds on top of upstream

Base: `TencentCloud/TencentDB-Agent-Memory` branch `feat/server_team` at `8b86874` (2026-09-29).
Goal: team memory for Claude Code **without the proxy** — native hooks + MCP, private GitLab
repositories in Code-Graph, deployed self-hosted.

Every upstream PR is merged as its own merge commit (`merge upstream PR #N: …`), so when upstream
merges one, `git merge upstream/feat/server_team` resolves it and the commit can be dropped on the
next rebuild.

## Merged upstream PRs

| PR | what | notes |
|---|---|---|
| #1437 | StorePool does not cache a failed init | clean |
| #1172 | store init cache self-heals after failure / closed store | clean |
| #1173 | `recordIds` filter honoured in sqlite `queryL1Records` | clean |
| #1491 | `idx_l0_user_agent_ts` for L0 pagination | clean |
| #1184 | remote embeddings token-aware, bounded retries | its tests were written before `sqlite.ts` moved to `sqlite/memory-store.ts`; moved them in the #1185 merge |
| #1554 | security hardening: gateway errors, callbacks, Git sources, proxy forwarding | clean |
| #1268 | **native Claude Code plugin (hooks + MCP, no proxy)** — `MemoryCore/claude-code-plugin/` | clean; tsc + 17 tests green |
| #1185 | non-destructive embedding reindex, shadow migration | conflicts with #1184 resolved by keeping both: `/health` reports embedding health, vector coverage and migration state |
| #1344 | `sendDimensions` forwarded to the sqlite embedding service | its new `store-pool.test.ts` collided with #1437's → kept as `store-pool.send-dimensions.test.ts`; mock gained `init()`/`isDegraded()` |
| #1502 | **private repos for Code-Graph via managed git credentials** (HTTPS token / SSH key, AES-256-GCM, `KNOWLEDGE_GIT_ALLOWED_HOSTS`) | conflict with #1554 in `git-fetcher.ts`: took #1502's `git-url.ts` validation, kept the old SSRF cases as `git-fetcher.ssrf.test.ts` — all 79 source-fetcher tests pass |

## Deliberately not merged (yet)

- **#1518** (Code-Graph keeps the last-good index on refresh failure, +7.8k lines): extracts the build
  worker into `code-graph-worker.ts`, while #1502 adds credential resolution into the old inline
  worker — a semantic conflict across 8 files, and #1518 has no approval. Re-evaluate once upstream
  merges either PR. The attempted combination lives on the local branch `pw/attempt-with-1518`.
- **#1501**: competing private-repo implementation to #1502, unreviewed.
- **#1316, #1368**: alternative subscription hooks (Python / Codex, ZCode). #1268 targets Claude Code
  directly; borrow ideas (retry of failed writes from #1368) rather than merge.
- Everything proxy-, DSH-, WorkBuddy-, Pi- and Codex-specific: we do not run the proxy.

## PostgreSQL + pgvector store backend (`STORE_MODE=postgres`)

Design: `docs/pw/2026-09-29-postgres-unified-mcp-design.md`. Code: `MemoryCore/src/core/store/postgres/`.
SQLite stays the default; nothing changes unless the mode is selected.

- **Selection**: `STORE_MODE=postgres` (gateway; `MEMORY_CORE_STORE_MODE=postgres` in
  `deploy/global-images/start-memory-core.sh`), or `memory.storeBackend: postgres` for the core/plugin path.
- **Connection**: `POSTGRES_URL` (required; the gateway fails at boot without it) and `POSTGRES_SCHEMA`
  (default `tdai`). The config block `memory.postgres.{url,schema}` is the fallback; env wins. Logs and the
  data-dir manifest carry `host:port/db` only.
- **Layout**: one schema per memory instance — `default` → the base schema, any other instance →
  `<base>_i_<slug>_<hash>` (the sqlite analogue is one `vectors.db` per instance). Tables come from versioned,
  idempotent migrations run at init under an advisory lock (`<schema>.schema_migrations`).
- **FTS**: the same jieba-tokenised text sqlite feeds FTS5 goes into a generated `tsvector` (`simple` config,
  GIN). Queries OR the phrase terms of `buildFtsQuery`; rank is `ts_rank_cd` mapped to 0..1 with the
  `bm25RankToScore` transform, so the `scoreThreshold=0.3` gate keeps its meaning (no IDF, unlike BM25).
- **Vectors**: `vector(N)` columns + HNSW (cosine), N = `memory.embedding.dimensions`; filtered KNN runs with
  `hnsw.iterative_scan = strict_order` (pgvector ≥ 0.8), so isolation filters cannot starve topK.
- **Isolation**: team/agent/user/session/task filters are WHERE clauses on every read, search and delete.
- **Skills**: `PostgresSkillStore` in the same schema; the gateway uses the per-instance skill path for postgres
  (as for tcvdb/mongodb). Keyword search only, like sqlite.
- Everything is parameterised; the only interpolated identifier is the schema, validated as `[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*`.

Deviations and unsupported optional methods:

- A dimension or embedding-contract change with stored vectors does **not** mark the store degraded (that
  would make StorePool discard the instance). As in the sqlite store it keeps the old vectors, reports
  `needsReindex`, turns `vectorSearch` off and skips vector writes; keyword search keeps working.
  `reindexAll` builds a shadow column and swaps it in only when every row re-embedded. With no stored
  vectors the columns are simply rebuilt.
- Not implemented (optional and synchronous on `IMemoryStore`, which a network store cannot serve):
  `getVectorCoverage`, `getEmbeddingMigrationStatus`, `commitEmbeddingMigration`,
  `rollbackEmbeddingMigration` — the shadow reindex commits itself instead. `searchL1Hybrid`/`searchL0Hybrid`
  are absent (`nativeHybridSearch=false`, callers fuse client-side as with sqlite).
- The store serves profile rows (`profileRows=true`), but `FILE_STORE_MODE=rowfs` is still restricted to
  `db.kind="mongodb"` by `validateResolution`; L2/L3 sync to rows works through the regular profile-sync path.
- The metadata service (`meta_*`, `MEMORY_CORE_METADATA_BACKEND`) and MemoryKnowledge are unchanged (sqlite).

Tests (Node 22, pgvector/pgvector:pg17 with pgvector 0.8.6 from `deploy/pw/docker-compose.dev.yml`; suites
create and drop their own `tdai_test_*` schema and skip when no database answers at `POSTGRES_TEST_URL`):

| suite | result |
|---|---|
| IMemoryStore contract, sqlite baseline (new runner) | 10/10 (the 2 profile-row cases return early: sqlite has no profile rows) |
| IMemoryStore contract, postgres | 10/10 |
| ISkillStore contract, postgres | 7/7 |
| postgres backend / lifecycle / wiring / skill specifics | 20 + 5 + 5 + 9 |
| MemoryCore full `vitest run` | 15 files, 93/93, exit 0 |

A gateway smoke run (`STORE_MODE=postgres`) wrote, queried and searched L0 through `/v3/conversation/*`, with
isolation holding across teams.

## Verification (Node 22)

| package | result |
|---|---|
| MemoryCore | vitest 27/27 (93/93 with the postgres backend and contract runners, see above) |
| MemoryKnowledge | vitest 161/161 |
| MemoryCore/claude-code-plugin | tsc clean, vitest 17/17 |

## Known issues inherited from upstream

- `MemoryKnowledge` `tsc --noEmit` fails in `src/middleware/response-envelope.ts:57`
  (`Promise<string>` vs `string` on `c.req.bodyCache.text`). The line is unchanged from upstream;
  the error comes from Hono 4.13 being pulled by the unpinned `^4.7.0` without a lockfile.
- Packages need **Node 22**: under Node 26 `better-sqlite3` has no prebuilt binary and `npm install`
  fails in node-gyp. `npm install` in MemoryKnowledge also trips on the workspace layout
  (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')`); `pnpm install --ignore-workspace` works. For MemoryCore add `--config.auto-install-peers=false`: the
  auto-installed optional peer `openclaw` now requires Node ≥ 24 and fails its preinstall under Node 22.
