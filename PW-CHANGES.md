# pw/main — what this fork adds on top of upstream

Base: `TencentCloud/TencentDB-Agent-Memory` branch `feat/server_team` at `8b86874` (2026-09-29).
Goal: team memory for Claude Code **without the proxy** — native hooks + MCP, private GitLab
repositories in Code-Graph, deployed self-hosted.

Every upstream PR is merged as its own merge commit (`merge upstream PR #N: …`), so when upstream
merges one, `git merge upstream/feat/server_team` resolves it and the commit can be dropped on the
next rebuild.

## Merged upstream PRs

| PR | what | notes |
|---|---|---|
| #1437 | StorePool does not cache a failed init | clean |
| #1172 | store init cache self-heals after failure / closed store | clean |
| #1173 | `recordIds` filter honoured in sqlite `queryL1Records` | clean |
| #1491 | `idx_l0_user_agent_ts` for L0 pagination | clean |
| #1184 | remote embeddings token-aware, bounded retries | its tests were written before `sqlite.ts` moved to `sqlite/memory-store.ts`; moved them in the #1185 merge |
| #1554 | security hardening: gateway errors, callbacks, Git sources, proxy forwarding | clean |
| #1268 | **native Claude Code plugin (hooks + MCP, no proxy)** — `MemoryCore/claude-code-plugin/` | clean; tsc + 17 tests green |
| #1185 | non-destructive embedding reindex, shadow migration | conflicts with #1184 resolved by keeping both: `/health` reports embedding health, vector coverage and migration state |
| #1344 | `sendDimensions` forwarded to the sqlite embedding service | its new `store-pool.test.ts` collided with #1437's → kept as `store-pool.send-dimensions.test.ts`; mock gained `init()`/`isDegraded()` |
| #1502 | **private repos for Code-Graph via managed git credentials** (HTTPS token / SSH key, AES-256-GCM, `KNOWLEDGE_GIT_ALLOWED_HOSTS`) | conflict with #1554 in `git-fetcher.ts`: took #1502's `git-url.ts` validation, kept the old SSRF cases as `git-fetcher.ssrf.test.ts` — all 79 source-fetcher tests pass |

## Deliberately not merged (yet)

- **#1518** (Code-Graph keeps the last-good index on refresh failure, +7.8k lines): extracts the build
  worker into `code-graph-worker.ts`, while #1502 adds credential resolution into the old inline
  worker — a semantic conflict across 8 files, and #1518 has no approval. Re-evaluate once upstream
  merges either PR. The attempted combination lives on the local branch `pw/attempt-with-1518`.
- **#1501**: competing private-repo implementation to #1502, unreviewed.
- **#1316, #1368**: alternative subscription hooks (Python / Codex, ZCode). #1268 targets Claude Code
  directly; borrow ideas (retry of failed writes from #1368) rather than merge.
- Everything proxy-, DSH-, WorkBuddy-, Pi- and Codex-specific: we do not run the proxy.

## pw-mcp: the single MCP server (`pw/mcp/`)

One stdio MCP server + hooks for Claude Code, configured by `TDAI_URL`, `KNOWLEDGE_URL`, `TDAI_USER_KEY`
(persisted by `pw-memory install` to `~/.config/pw-memory/config.json`, 0600). Usage in `pw/mcp/README.md`.

What is reused, and how — everything is imported from source and bundled with esbuild; nothing is copied:

| from | imported | not imported, and why |
|---|---|---|
| `MemoryCore/claude-code-plugin` (#1268) | `createClaudeCodeMcpServer` (run in-process behind an `InMemoryTransport`), `handleHook`, `PluginState`, `loadConfig`, `KnowledgeServiceClient`, `MEMORY_TOOLS_GUIDE` | `hooks/cli.ts`, `mcp/stdio.ts`: entry points that read the plugin's own env names; replaced by ~15 lines of glue that feed the same functions from the pw config |
| `MemoryKnowledge/src/mcp` | `tools.ts` (`MCP_TOOLS`, the 12 definitions) | `server.ts`: its `import.meta.url === argv[1]` main-guard is true for every module of a bundle, so importing it starts a second stdio server; its 12-line result mapping is mirrored in `knowledge-backend.ts`. `http-client.ts`: `callApi` sends neither `x-tdai-service-id` nor `team_id`, which every multi-tenant `/v3` route requires — against the current service **all 12 upstream knowledge MCP tools answer 400**. Calls go through the plugin's `KnowledgeServiceClient` instead |

Decisions:

- **Tool names**: MemoryKnowledge's 12 keep their upstream names, the plugin's are already `tdai_`-prefixed;
  no collisions (unit-tested; the registry would keep the first owner and log). With both halves on, the
  plugin's `tdai_wiki_search` / `tdai_wiki_pages` / `tdai_wiki_read` are dropped as duplicates of
  `wiki_search` / `wiki_list` / `wiki_read`; `tdai_wiki_list` and `tdai_wiki_write` stay (no equivalent).
  The hook rewrites the one guide line that names the dropped tools. 18 tools total.
- **Halves are optional**: unset URL → that half is not built, a stderr note says so; zero tools is a valid
  state. Hooks answer `{}` without touching the network when `TDAI_URL` is unset.
- **Prompt caching**: tool list and instructions fixed at startup; recall only via `additionalContext`.
  Stable block once per session, `<relevant-memories>` per prompt (table in the README).
- **stdout hygiene**: `stdio-guard.ts` routes `console.log/info/debug` to stderr (MemoryKnowledge's logger
  writes debug to stdout, which would corrupt JSON-RPC).
- **Hook commands** are `"<abs node>" "<abs dist/cli.js>" pw-memory-hook` with only `type`/`command`/`timeout`
  keys; the plugin's `integrations/hooks.json` uses `args` and `statusMessage`, which we did not rely on.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` is not committed: the repo's `.gitignore` ignores it everywhere.

Caveats found on the way:

- **`TDAI_USER_KEY` is not per-person on the data plane yet.** The gateway's `/v3` memory routes check one
  shared Bearer (`TDAI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`) and take identity from `team_id`/`agent_id`/`user_id` in the body;
  the per-user `sk-mem-…` keys are only resolved on `/v3/meta/*`. So the "user key" works as the gateway key
  today, and isolation comes from `TDAI_USER_ID` (default `default` — a warning is logged). MemoryKnowledge's
  `KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_KEY` is likewise one service-wide key.
- The memory SDK's HTTP transport disables TLS verification by default (`rejectUnauthorized: false`).
- The plugin's `KnowledgeServiceClient` throws `HTTP 404` without the envelope message (`code graph not found`).
- In knowledge-only mode there is no tool to list wikis or code graphs (`tdai_wiki_list` comes with the memory
  half; neither side exposes `code-graph/list`).

Verification (Node 22.23.3): `pw/mcp` tsc clean, vitest 35/35; `scripts/smoke.sh` → `SMOKE OK` against
MemoryCore standalone (SQLite) + MemoryKnowledge with an unreachable LLM (memory write/read-back, 404-clean
knowledge errors, hooks incl. Stop capture found in L0, install/uninstall on a throwaway HOME).
MemoryCore's `pnpm install` needs `--config.auto-install-peers=false`, otherwise the optional peer `openclaw`
(Node ≥ 24) fails its preinstall.

## Known issues inherited from upstream

- `MemoryKnowledge` `tsc --noEmit` fails in `src/middleware/response-envelope.ts:57`
  (`Promise<string>` vs `string` on `c.req.bodyCache.text`). The line is unchanged from upstream;
  the error comes from Hono 4.13 being pulled by the unpinned `^4.7.0` without a lockfile.
- Packages need **Node 22**: under Node 26 `better-sqlite3` has no prebuilt binary and `npm install`
  fails in node-gyp. `npm install` in MemoryKnowledge also trips on the workspace layout
  (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')`); `pnpm install --ignore-workspace` works.
